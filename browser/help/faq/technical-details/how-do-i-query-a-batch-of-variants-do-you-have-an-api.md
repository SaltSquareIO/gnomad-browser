question: 'How do I query a batch of variants? Do you have an API?'
---

The [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API used by the browser is open to the public. Please see our [data page](/data) for more details on how to use our API.

You can also obtain information on all variants from the VCFs and Hail Tables available on our [data page](/data).
